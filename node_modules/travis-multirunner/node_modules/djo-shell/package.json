  "readme": "# djo-shell\n\nA series of shell scripts that I use in various things.  Installable using NPM:\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/djo-shell.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/djo-shell/)\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installing using npm, you should be able to run the following commands:\n\n### `browser-version <browser> <version>`\n\nGet pipe (`|`) separated details of the target browser version you are interested in for linux_x64:\n\n```sh\nbrowser-version chrome stable\n\n# download the deb file for a version\nwget `browser-version chrome stable | cut -d'|' -f4`\n\n# or, just echo the version of chrome beta\nbrowser-version chrome beta | cut -d'|' -f3\n```\n\n### `browser-list`\n\nUse [`parallel`](http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) to retrieve some well known combinations of the browsers (in parallel):\n\n```sh\nbrowser-list\n```\n\nWhich would generate output similar to the following:\n\n```\nfirefox|stable|36.0.4|http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/latest/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-36.0.4.tar.bz2\nchrome|beta|42.0.2311.60|https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-beta_current_amd64.deb\nchrome|unstable|43.0.2334.0|https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-unstable_current_amd64.deb\nchrome|stable|41.0.2272.101|https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\nfirefox|beta|37.0b7|http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/latest-beta/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-37.0b7.tar.bz2\nfirefox|unstable|39.0a1|http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/firefox-39.0a1.en-US.linux-x86_64.tar.bz2\n```\n\n### `dirtygit`\n\n```sh\ndirtygit\n```\n\nIterate through the directories that are direct children of this directory and report if they are:\n\n1. A git repository\n2. Have either new or modified files\n3. Are out of sync with upstream\n\n### `npmd-all-the-things`\n\nIn preparation for potentially having no net access for a while, I'm using @dominictarr's [npmd](https://github.com/dominictarr/npmd) to bring modules I need (or potentially might use down locally). I'm sure the script can use some improvements, but it works well enough for me know.Basically, head into a parent directory somewhere where you have projects, and then run `npmd-all-the-things`. I've got a few different project containers (personal projects, rtc.io, forks, etc) which means running the script a few times but that's not too much of a hassle.\n\n### `npm-all-the-things`\n\nLike `npmd-all-the-things` but just using npm with a really long `cache-min` time.\n\n## LICENSE\n\n### ISC\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 - 2016, Damon Oehlman <damon.oehlman@gmail.com>\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any\npurpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\ncopyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH\nREGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY\nAND FITNESS.
