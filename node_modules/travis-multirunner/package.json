  "readme": "# Travis Multirunner\n\nThis is a set of scripts designed to help you get up and running multibrowser tests on [travis](http://travis-ci.org). The scripts themselves are designed to be fetched during a travis `before_script` process and used to prepare your environment.\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/travis-multirunner.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/travis-multirunner/)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DamonOehlman/travis-multirunner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DamonOehlman/travis-multirunner)\n\n## Usage\n\nUsing `travis-multirunner` has never been easier, simply install using:\n\n```\nnpm install travis-multirunner@latest --save-dev\n```\n\nMost of the work will be done for you!  A `.travis.yml` configuration file will be generated from the [`template.yaml`](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/travis-multirunner/blob/master/template.yaml) file in this repo and should allow you to start making use of environment variable driven travis [build matrix](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-configuration/#The-Build-Matrix) builds.\n\n### Use with testling\n\nFor use with [`testling`](https://github.com/substack/testling):\n\n- install required dev dependencies\n  \n  ```\n  npm install testling --save-dev\n  ```\n  \n- Add the following command to your npm `test` script:\n\n  ```\n  testling -x start-$BROWSER\n  ```\n\n### Use with broth\n\nFor use with [`broth`](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/broth):\n\n- install required dev dependencies\n  \n  ```\n  npm install browserify broth tap-spec --save-dev\n  ```\n  \n- Add the following command to your npm `test` script:\n\n  ```\n  browserify test/all.js | broth start-$BROWSER | tap-spec\n  ```\n\n### Use with smokestack\n\nUse with [`smokestack`](https://github.com/hughsk/smokestack) has not yet been investigated...\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you want to patch travis-multirunner, here's what you have to do:\n\n- clone this repo\n- npm install\n- export BROWSER=chrome BVER=stable (or any other combo of your choice).\n  This is required for the next steps.\n- ./setup.sh\n- npm test\n- exit the browser started\n\nMake your patches and test them in the usual fashion, and create a pull\nrequest. The pull request will run Travis to verify that your patch works\nfor all the standard browser combos.\n\n## Prior Art\n\nNone of this would have been possible without the docs and code listed below:\n\n- [Automated testing in Travis CI for WebRTC](http://lynckia.com/licode/travis-webrtc.html)\n\n- `.travis-setup.sh` from the [web-animations-js](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js) project\n\n- Travis docs on [GUI and Headless Browsers](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/gui-and-headless-browsers/)\n\n## LICENSE\n\n### ISC\n\nCopyright (c) 2015, Damon Oehlman <damon.oehlman@gmail.com>\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any\npurpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\ncopyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH\nREGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY\nAND FITNESS.
